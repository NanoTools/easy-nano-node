## Q&A

### Updating the node
Just enter the install command again:

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanotools/easy-nano-node/master/install.sh)
```

Et voilÃ ! Have a look at the Node Monitor, you should run the newest Nano Node version.

### Node Monitor Overview
You have no idea what all those numbers and fields in the node monitor mean? Have a look [at the official Wiki](https://github.com/NanoTools/nanoNodeMonitor/wiki/Monitor-Overview).

### Node isn't synced
Let it node sync the full ledger, this can take some hours. You can always compare to the current block count [here](https://www.nanode.co/blocks).

### Account not opened
The account has no transactions in the ledger. Send some Nano to the address to open it.

### Nano isn't received
The Nano node has a configurable receive minimum which is at default 1 Nano. You can set it in the config.json (`~/RaiBlocks/config.json`). [More information at the wiki](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/wiki/config.json).

### How do I send Nano from the node account?
The easiest way is entering the account seed into a web wallet like [NanoVault](https://nanovault.io/). You can also use the [RPC interface](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/wiki/RPC-protocol#send).

### Node Monitor Overview
If you don't know what all those numbers in the node monitor mean [take at look at the wiki](https://github.com/NanoTools/nanoNodeMonitor/wiki/Monitor-Overview). 

### Node is stuck / unresponsive
Restart the Node container with `sudo docker restart enn_nanonode_1`.

### Questions not answered?
